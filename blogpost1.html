        <p><h4>Avionics (a portmanteau of aviation and electronics) are the electronic systems used on aircraft. Avionic systems include communications, navigation, the display and management of multiple systems, and the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions. These can be as simple as a searchlight for a police helicopter or as complicated as the tactical system for an airborne early warning platform.</h4></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Modern Avionics</h2>
        <p><h4>Avionics plays a heavy role in modernization initiatives like the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System project in the United States and the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiative in Europe. The Joint Planning and Development Office put forth a roadmap for avionics in six areas:</h4></p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>1- Published Routes and Procedures: Improved navigation and routing</li>
            <li>2- Negotiated Trajectories: Adding data communications to create preferred routes dynamically</li>
            <li>3- Delegated Separation: Enhanced situational awareness in the air and on the ground</li>
            <li>4- Low Visibility/Ceiling Approach/Departure: Allowing operations with weather constraints with less ground infrastructure</li>
            <li>5- Surface Operations: To increase safety in approach and departure</li>
            <li>6- ATM Efficiencies: Improving the air traffic management (ATM) process</li>
        </ol>
